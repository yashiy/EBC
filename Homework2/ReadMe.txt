This is the EtchASketch program. You will need four push buttons to run this. 
Wire the pushbuttons to the pins listed as inputs in the .js file. For each
pushbutton, one side should go to a gpio pin and the other should go to the 
power. 
 When you run this program, you should see the '+' sign move in the direction 
you tell it to. For example, if you push the right button, the '+' will move 
to the right (it leaves a "*" in the positions it has been in').
